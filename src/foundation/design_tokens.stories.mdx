# Design Tokens

We are using CSS variables as Design Tokens. They are the very basis for the design system.

The variables are hierarchically seperated in global, alias and component-specific tokens.

For more information see [the information on design tokens of Adobes design system](https://readymag.com/u40694597/voltbrandguidance/colors/).

The variables are defined in `src/global/variables`.
